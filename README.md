# HINN_unofficial_paper_implementation

This repository contains an unofficial implementation of the paper HINN: Hierarchical Input Neural Network identifies multi-omics biomarker for cognitive decline. It is not officially endorsed by the original authors. While I have aimed for accuracy, there may be differences between this code and the original implementation used in the paper.
